# f_web_authentication_firebas_template

An implementation of https://github.com/augustosalazar/f_web_authentication/ with support for Firebase.

Only required changed is to change the id of user to String, apart from that it is only a matter completing the TODOs.

Use the repo https://github.com/augustosalazar/f_firebase_202210 as reference for authentication with Firebase.

Create the firebase project and enable authentication with email/password and databse firestore.   

Run flutterfire configure to setup firebase for your project, with this you should get:
/android/app/google-services.json
/lib/firebase_options.dart
firebase.json
